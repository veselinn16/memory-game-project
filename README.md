# Memory Game

## Description
A fun game to test the strength of your memory. All you have to do is turn the cards around and memorize the symbols in order to match them with their corresponding pairs.

## Game logic:
The game is composed of a board with a total of 16 cards, spread in 4 rows and 4 columns. Upon clicking the first card a timer starts which will determine the time in which you complete the game.
There is a rating system based on moves. The maximum rating you can get is _3 stars_. After a certain number of moves, the rating will go down, so be focused! ;)
Once all cards are matched, a modal will appear, telling you the number of moves, the time and the rating.

## Languages used for development:
- HTML
- CSS
- SASS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- The Sass compiler from NPM

## How to start the game:
To start the game, open `index.html` and have fun!
