# **Memory Game - a fun way to test the strength of your memory**

## Game logic:
The game is composed of a board with a total of 16 cards, spread in 4 rows and 4 columns. Upon clicking the first card a timer starts which will determine the time in which you complete the game.
There is a rating system based on moves. The maximum rating you can get is _3 stars_. After a certain number of moves, the rating will go down, so be focused! ;)
Once all cards are matched, a modal will appear, telling you the number of moves, the time and the rating.
